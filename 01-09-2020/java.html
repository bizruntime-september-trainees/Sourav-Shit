<em>Prerequisites</em></center><br>

<h3>Before you start practicing various types of examples given in this reference, we assume that you are already aware about computer programs and computer programming languages.</h3><br>
<h3>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.

<h3>In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</h3>
<h3 style="font-size:20px;color:Violet;">
<em>Platform Independent-</h3></em>
<h3>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</h3>
